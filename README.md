### Code Challenge

**Challenge: Create a "Case Studies" Component**

- **Description:** You are requested to create a "Case Studies" component in React that includes a section title, a description, and cards. Each card should be able to display a resource (image or video), along with a title and a description.
  
- **Requirements:**
  - Implement Atomic Design principles, ensuring that each card is a reusable component.
  - Use a design pattern that allows for the flexibility to render a card with an image or a card with a video.
  - For the component displaying the video, it should play the video when the image is clicked.
  - Create the component as similar as you can.

- **Deliverables:**
  - Instructions on how to run the component locally.

With these additional questions, you will gain a more comprehensive view of the candidate's experience and skills in key areas for your team. Good luck!
